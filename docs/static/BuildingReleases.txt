To create a release version:
 - Dedicate an empty folder to contain the release version. It will be referred to as /release in this file. Other directories are relative to the project root: /
 - Rebuild and recompile the project using release config (cmake --config Release?) on the platform you wish to build for (TODO: find a way to cross-compile?).
 - For every module below, follow the instructions for the platform you are currently building for.
 - Once the release version has been created, run it on a fresh virtual machine of the platform the release was built for to verify that it works.
