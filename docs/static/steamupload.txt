# This document will cover how to upload a game build to steam (and set it live).
# It is assumed that all tests have been run and that the game is in a release-ready state.
# 
# Only lead developers have the necessary steam permissions to upload a game build.
#
# "Platform(s)" in this document refer to the operating systems that we currently support (Windows, Mac, and Linux)

From Steamworks:
 - Navigate to the Duct Tape and Dreams (DTAD) App Admin page on the steamworks website: https://partner.steamgames.com/apps/landing/3433930
 - Click (Edit Steamworks Settings)->(SteamPipe)->(Depots)
 - Create 3 new depots (one for each platform) with the names DTAD {version} {Platform}. Make sure to set the architecture to '64-bit OS Only' and the Operating System to the platform that depot is for. Keep track of the Depot IDs (e.g. 3433931). Example:
	Depot ID || Description		 || Operating System || Architecture
	3433331		DTAD 0.1.0 Windows  Windows				64-bit OS Only
	3433932		DTAD 0.1.0 Linux    Linux				64-bit OS Only
	3433933		DTAD 0.1.0 Mac 		Mac					64-bit OS Only

 
From a Windows machine (SteamPipeGUI only supports Windows as of June 11, 2025):
 - Create a set of directories with the following structure:
	
	DTAD_release_{version}/
		Windows/
		Mac/
		Linux/
	
 - Using the process outlined in BuildingReleases.txt, create release versions for the game platforms.
 - For each release, copy the contents of the release/ folder into its respective platform folder from above
 - If needed, install SteamPipeGUI:
	- Download the latest version of the Steamworks SDK (currently 1.62) from: https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/list
	- Unzip the SDK
	- Navigate to sdk/tools/SteamPipeGUI.zip
	- Unzip SteamPipeGUI

 - Launch SteamPipeGUI.exe
 - Under Depot Configuration, add 3 depots (one for each platform).
 - Copy the 3 depot IDs from Steamworks to the depot IDs in SteamPipeGUI.
 - For each depot, under 'Build Path', add the full directory path to the platform folder for that depot. Example:
	Depot ID || Build Path
	3433331		path/to/DTAD_release_0.1.0/Windows
    3433932		path/to/DTAD_release_0.1.0/Linux
    3433933		path/to/DTAD_release_0.1.0/Mac
	
 - If the Steamworks SDK ContentBuilder path is not yet filled, fill it with path/to/your_installed_SDK/sdk/tools/ContentBuilder
 - Fill in steam login info
 - Click 'Generate VDFs'
 - Click 'Upload' (you may need to approve the upload with 2FA)
 
Useful Info:
	To set a build as live:
	 - Navigate to the Builds page in steamworks (From DTAD app admin page: (Edit Steamworks Settings)->(SteamPipe)->(Builds))
	 - On the build you wish to set as live, use the 'Set build as live option'
	 
	To combine multiple builds into a new build (there should be an easier way to do this):
	 - Create a new app branch
	 - Add the relevant builds to that branch
	 - It should give you an option to combine builds into a new single build
     - Delete temporary branch
