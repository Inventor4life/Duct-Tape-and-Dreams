The /docs/ folder (and by extension, project documentation) is divided into two sections: Pages, and Static.
The /static/ folder contains the project documentation associated with that game version, available offline.
The /pages/ folder is intended for use within Github Pages and can generate/resolve permalinks to any documentation version.

It is done this way because we've all sought help from a 9 year old stackoverflow question where the accepted answer is a dead link.

This README file is intended as a temporary explanation of the doc system and may be modified/removed as the system matures.
