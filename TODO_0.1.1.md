# TODO
## CMake
 - Test find_package for major packages (luajit, SFML, box2d, sol2, etc...) and make sure they aren't being re-downloaded if a working copy already exists in /build/

## Other
 - Gather dependency licenses into license.txt files and place them in docs/static/
 - Research how to upload a game build to Steam and document the process in docs/static/steamupload.txt
 - Finish filling out docs/static/BuildingReleases.txt
 - Design development workflow and document it in docs/static/workflow.txt
